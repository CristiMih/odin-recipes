   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>This immune boosting breakfast provides the fibre beta glucan,
     believed to enhance the bodyâ€™s resistance to viral and bacterial pathogens.
      Elderberries are packed with antioxidants and used therapeutically to relieve sinus 
      pain and flu type symptoms. Pumpkin seeds are an important source of dietary zinc,
     an immune-enhancing mineral that has been found to shorten the duration of the common 
     cold.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

       <li>2 tbsp of coconut flour</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons chia seeds</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons flax meal</li>
       <li>dried elderberries - 140g</li>
       <li>water - 800ml</li>
       <li>2 star anise</li>
       <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
       <li>4 cardamom pods</li>
       <li>5 tbsp maple syrup</li>
       <li>pumpkin seeds -30g</li>
       
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the dried elderberries in cold water to rehydrate overnight.</li>
            <li>The next day put the berries in a saucepan with the other syrup ingredients 
                (apart from the maple syrup). Bring to a boil then simmer for 30 minutes.
                 Remove the pan from the heat, 
                crush the berries with the back of a spoon to extract any remaining flesh.</li>
            <li>Sieve the mixture into a sterilised jar.
                 The syrup can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 months.</li>
            <li>Soak the oats overnight in water. In the morning put the oats in a pan and add 100ml
                 of oat milk and the 200ml of water. Heat gently, stirring until the oats are cooked 
                 through. 
                You may want to adjust the amount of milk/water depending on how thick you like your 
                porridge.</li>
                <li>To serve, pour the porridge into a warmed bowl, swirl on the elderberry 
                    syrup and top with pumpkin seeds. 
                    Add a handful of fresh berries to boost the antioxidant load.</li>
                    <li>
                        Porridge not your thing? Dilute the syrup in warm water for a 
                        soothing drink.
                    </li>
    </ol>
