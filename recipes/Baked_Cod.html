   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>If you are looking for a new fish recipe, you must try my cod with mustard sauce!
     Cod filets are smothered in a mixture of sour cream and two types of mustard, 
     then baked in the oven till done. 
    Juicy and flavourful. Even non-fish lovers will appreciate it!
      </p>

    <li>4-6 cod pieces ~ 700g</li>

       <li>1 tbsp whole-grain mustard</li>
       <li>1 leek white part only, minced</li>
       <li>1 tbsp drained capers</li>
       <li>1 tbsp fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Butter a skiller or a shallow baking dish and arrange cod on it. 
                Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Mix sour cream or creme fraiche, 
                both mustards, chopped leek and capers in a medium bowl. 
                Spoon the sauce over the fish, it should be covered in an even layer of sauce.</li>
            <li>Roast in the oven for 10-12 minutes. 
                Change your oven setting to broil/grill and continue cooking for 2-3 
                more minutes until the sauce is slightly blistered.

    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Fish goes so well with rice, potatoes or cauliflower rice if you are going low carb. The mustard sauce in this recipe is ideal for flavouring your side as well. </p>
